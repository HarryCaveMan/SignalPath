// The simplest possible sbt build file is just one line:

scalaVersion := "2.13.3"

name := "hello-world"
organization := "ch.epfl.scala"
version := "1.0"

// Want to use a published library in your project?
// You can define other libraries as dependencies in your build like this:

libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.1.2"

// Here, `libraryDependencies` is a set of dependencies, and by using `+=`,

// TIP: To find the "dependency" that you need to add to the
// `libraryDependencies` set, which in the above example looks like this:

// "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "1.1.2"

// You can use Scaladex, an index of all known published Scala libraries. There,
// after you find the library you want, you can just copy/paste the dependency
// information that you need into your build file. For example, on the
// scala/scala-parser-combinators Scaladex page,
// https://index.scala-lang.org/scala/scala-parser-combinators, you can copy/paste
// the sbt dependency from the sbt box on the right-hand side of the screen.

// Most moderately interesting Scala projects don't make use of the very simple
// build file style (called "bare style") used in this build.sbt file. Most
// intermediate Scala projects make use of so-called "multi-project" builds. A
// multi-project build makes it possible to have different folders which sbt can
// be configured differently for. That is, you may wish to have different
// dependencies or different testing frameworks defined for different parts of
// your codebase. Multi-project builds make this possible.

// Here's a quick glimpse of what a multi-project build looks like for this
// build, with only one "subproject" defined, called `root`:

// lazy val root = (project in file(".")).
//   settings(
//     inThisBuild(List(
//       organization := "ch.epfl.scala",
//       scalaVersion := "2.13.3"
//     )),
//     name := "hello-world"
//   )

// documentation at http://www.scala-sbt.org/documentation.html
